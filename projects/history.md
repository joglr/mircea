# Past Projects

I keep telling my students, software is like *performance art*. 
You're either there to see it while it runs. 
Or you might at best see a screencast about it.
Or read a story about how it worked. 

The projects on this page are projects that I've been involved with but are discontinued and neither I nor anybody else is maintaining them.
