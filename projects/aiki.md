**Aiki** is a martial arts principle that allows a practitioner to redirect an opponent's power back against themselves. 

Aiki is also a browser extension that considers social media (and other time-wasting websites) as the oponent that needs to be fought back against.

In the *aiki*-way, the project proposes that an internet user can take advantage of their habits of visiting time-wasting web sites as a reminder for doing something that they themselves percieve as being useful, e.g. learning Danish or getting better at programming in Python. 

[Nanna Inie](https://pure.itu.dk/en/persons/nanna-inie) directed an amazing video showcasing Aiki for our CHI'21 presentation.

## Papers

CHI'23: [**Challenges and Opportunities of Using Redirection of Activity for Self-Regulation Online**](../docs/assets/papers/Aiki-CHI23.pdf)
- A paper that investigates how Aiki 2.0 -- an improved version of Aiki in terms of usability -- fares to help people drop procrastination and instead learn programming with the help of micro-learning activities

CHI'21: [**Aiki: Turning Procrastination into Microlearning**](../docs/assets/papers/Aiki-CHI21.pdf) 
- A study with Nanna Inie 
- Shows that people who want to learn Danish can use redirection from time-wasting-websites as a strategy and cue to remember that they should learn
 - Our participants learned quite a bit of Danish and some of them actually found the learning a better use of their time than the 'mindless' scrolling on Facebook

## Future Work
- Short Term
	- generalize the extension
		- remove the hardcoded redirections to either language websites or programmig; let people redirect to whatever they like
	- publish the extesion 
		- publish also for Firefox besides Chrome
		- make the backend ready for publication
- design a large scale in-the-wild expertiment 
- Longer Term
	- implement interceptions also on mobile devices
