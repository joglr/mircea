"Social media companies aim to [colonize](https://twitter.com/JoshuaPHilll/status/1587857229054705666) every minute of our lives". (Bo Burnham )

**Aiki-do** is a martial art that is based on the precept of using an enemy's force against themselves. 

This project considers the social media websites as **the enemy that aims to waste our time**. In the *aiki*-way, the project proposes that we can make use of our tendency to go to these time-wasting web sites. Indeed, if we intercept our attempts to go to such a website and use it as reminder for doing something useful, e.g. learning we can using th enemy's force against themselves. 

## Papers

[**Aiki: Turning Procrastination into Microlearning**](/docs/assets/papers/21-Aiki.pdf) 
	- A study with Nanna Inie 
	- Shows that people who want to learn Danish can use redirection from time-wasting-websites as a strategy and cue to remember that they should learn
	- Our participants learned quite a bit of Danish and some of them actually found the learning a better use of their time than the 'mindless' scrolling on Facebook


## Prototpye 
A Chrome extension that helps one save time by redirecting them to a useful site when they try to go to a time-wasting site. Useful and time-wasting are user defined.

## Future Work
- prepare the extension for a large scale case study
	- allow user-definition of any time-saving websites
	- make the backend ready for publication
	- design the expertiment 
- implement interceptions also on mobile devices
