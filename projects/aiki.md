"Social media companies aim to [colonize](https://twitter.com/JoshuaPHilll/status/1587857229054705666) every minute of our lives". (Bo Burnham )

**Aiki-do** is a martial art that is based on the precept of using an enemy's force against themselves. 

This project considers the social media websites as **the enemy that aims to waste our time**. In the *aiki*-way, the project proposes that we can make use of our tendency to go to these time-wasting web sites. Indeed, if we intercept our attempts to go to such a website and use it as reminder for doing something useful, e.g. learning we can using th enemy's force against themselves.

## Papers

CHI'23: [**Challenges and Opportunities of Using Redirection of Activity for Self-Regulation Online**](../docs/assets/papers/Aiki-CHI23.pdf)
- A paper that investigates how Aiki 2.0 -- an improved version of Aiki in terms of usability -- fares to help people drop procrastination and instead learn programming with the help of micro-learning activities

CHI'21: [**Aiki: Turning Procrastination into Microlearning**](../docs/assets/papers/Aiki-CHI21.pdf) 
- A study with Nanna Inie 
- Shows that people who want to learn Danish can use redirection from time-wasting-websites as a strategy and cue to remember that they should learn
 - Our participants learned quite a bit of Danish and some of them actually found the learning a better use of their time than the 'mindless' scrolling on Facebook
