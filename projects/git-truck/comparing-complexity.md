# Using Git-Truck to Copare System Complexity

I was in a research research project defense in which two students were proposing to compare two open source systems for their upcoming thesis: VLC -- the well-known video player -- and A32NX -- a fly-by-wire simulator. 

I quickly cloned them and opened them with Git-Truck.

It became very quickly evident that the two are not of the same complexity: neither in terms of size nor in terms of collaboration or commit history. VLC is really a monster with >800 contributors and many more files. A good discussion followed about the appropriateness of comparing the two systems for their thesis.
