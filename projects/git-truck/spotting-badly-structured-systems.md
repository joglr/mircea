Your students have implemented a beautiful interactive application in React that provides school kids with the opportunity to practice mathematics exercises. It all looks beautiful from a UI POV. You don't have much time to look into the details of the codebase, so you fire up Git-Truck and look at the files that have the most commits. The `MultipleChoice.js` has by far the largest number of commits. You investigate further, and realize that it represents a multiple choice question component. Only that it is so much more. It is a God Component if ever was one. It should have been refactored. You use this class to start discussing the codebase with the students.
