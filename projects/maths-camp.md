# MathsCamp

![](../docs/assets/mathscamp-logo.png)
The project started as a collaboration with Simona Tudoran, a maths teacher from London. 

The current state of the project is the result of a student thesis and two research projects: 

- Anne & Frederikke, in their thesis, [created the first version of the app](../docs/assets/theses/AnneFrederikke--Designing%20a%20personalized%20learning%20app.pdf)  and evaluated it with students.
- Tamara, in her research project, [added personalized progress feedback](../docs/assets/theses/Thesis-Tamara-MathsCamp_Personal_Progress_Feedback.pdf) and studied it's impact on motivation.
- Mia, in her research project, [added a social component](../docs/assets/theses/Mia_Ronnelund_Thesis_2022.pdf) and evaluated it's impact with students. 

The project is available at [mathscamp.org](mathscamp.org).
