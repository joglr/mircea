# MathsCamp - Personalized, adaptive, and social maths learning 

![](../docs/assets/mathscamp-logo.png)
The project started as a collaboration with Simona Tudoran, a maths teacher from London. 

The current state of the project is the result of a three theses. 

- Anne & Frederikke, in their MSc thesis, designed, implemented, and evaluated the first version of MathsCamp and wrote about all these [in their thesis](../docs/assets/theses/AnneFrederikke--Designing%20a%20personalized%20learning%20app.pdf). 
- Tamara, in her BSc project, [added personalized progress feedback](../docs/assets/theses/Thesis-Tamara-MathsCamp_Personal_Progress_Feedback.pdf) and studied it's impact on motivation.
- Mia, in her research project, [added a social component](../docs/assets/theses/Mia_Ronnelund_Thesis_2022.pdf): the students in a classroom can now see how are they ranking in comparison with a few of the neighbourly ranked students. A lot of thinking went into figuring out a way to ensure that the social component is encouraging. 

The project is available at [mathscamp.org](mathscamp.org). 

The code is open source and available on GitHub at [[https://github.com/MathsCamp/MathsCamp]].
