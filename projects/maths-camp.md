# MathsCamp - Personalized, adaptive, and social maths learning 

![](../docs/assets/mathscamp-logo.png)
The project started as a collaboration with [**Simona Tudoran**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simona-tudoran-7a974a21/), a friend and maths teacher from London. She is really passionate about mathematics and teaching, and had many maths problems that she wanted to be able to share with students in an intelligent way. 

The project is available at [mathscamp.org](mathscamp.org). 

The **code** is **open source** and available on GitHub at [/MathsCamp/MathsCamp](https://github.com/MathsCamp/MathsCamp)

The current state of the project is the result of three distinct theses. 

- **Anne & Frederikke**, in their MSc thesis, designed, implemented, and evaluated the first version of MathsCamp and wrote about all these [in their thesis](../docs/assets/theses/AnneFrederikke--Designing%20a%20personalized%20learning%20app.pdf). 
- **Tamara**, in her BSc project, [added personalized progress feedback](../docs/assets/theses/Thesis-Tamara-MathsCamp_Personal_Progress_Feedback.pdf) and studied it's impact on motivation.
- **Mia**, in her thesis, [added a social component](../docs/assets/theses/Mia_Ronnelund_Thesis_2022.pdf): the students in a classroom can now see how are they ranking in comparison with a few of the neighbourly ranked students. A lot of thinking went into figuring out a way to ensure that the social component is encouraging.
