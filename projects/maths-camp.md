# MathsCamp

The project started as a collaboration with Simona Tudoran, a maths teacher from London. 

The current state of the project is the result of a student thesis and two research projects: 
- Anne & Frederikke, in their thesis, [created the first version of the app and evaluated it with students](../docs/assets/theses/AnneFrederikke--Designing%20a%20personalized%20learning%20app.pdf)
- Tamara, in her research project, [added personalized progress feedback and studied it's impact on motivation](../docs/assets/theses/Thesis-Tamara-MathsCamp_Personal_Progress_Feedback.pdf) 
- Mia, in her research project, [added a social component and evaluated it's impact](../docs/assets/theses/Mia_Ronnelund_Thesis_2022.pdf)

The project is available at [mathscamp.org](mathscamp.org).
