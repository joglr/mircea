## Papers

1. **[Git-Truck: Hierarchy-Oriented Visualization of Git Repository Evolution](/docs/assets/papers/22-Git-Truck.pdf)** - a paper in which we show 
	- how git-truck works
	- results of an async user evaluation that shows which users benefit the most from such a tool and in which way

2. **[Can Git Visualization Support Educators in Assessing Group Projects?](/docs/assets/papers/22-Git-Vis-4Edu.pdf)** - a paper which
	- argues that educators are a special kind of user for repository visualization, and lists some of their specific needs
	- shows with examples the kinds of information educators can gain by using Git-Truck


## Future Work
- comment analysis to support module understanding
