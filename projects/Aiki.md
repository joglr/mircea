## Papers

[**Aiki: Turning Procrastination into Microlearning**](/docs/assets/papers/21-Aiki.pdf) 
	- A study with Nanna Inie 
	- Shows that people who want to learn Danish can use redirection from time-wasting-websites as a strategy and cue to remember that they should learn
	- Our participants learned quite a bit of Danish and some of them actually found the learning a better use of their time than the 'mindless' scrolling on Facebook


## Future Work
- allow user-definition of any time-saving websites
- make the backend ready for publication
- run very large scale study
