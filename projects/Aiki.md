# Aiki

**Aiki-do** is a martial art that is based on the precept of using an enemy's force against them. 

This project considers the social media websites as **the enemy that aims to waste our time**. (Or as Bo Burnham observed, the companies behind social media aim to [colonize](https://twitter.com/JoshuaPHilll/status/1587857229054705666) every minute of our lives). Instead, the project proposes that we use our tendency to go to these time-wasting web sites as reminders for doing something useful, e.g. learning. In this way, we are using our enemy's force against them. 

A Chrome extension that helps one save time by redirecting them to a useful site when they try to go to a time-wasting site. Useful and time-wasting are user defined.

## Papers

[**Aiki: Turning Procrastination into Microlearning**](/docs/assets/papers/21-Aiki.pdf) 
	- A study with Nanna Inie 
	- Shows that people who want to learn Danish can use redirection from time-wasting-websites as a strategy and cue to remember that they should learn
	- Our participants learned quite a bit of Danish and some of them actually found the learning a better use of their time than the 'mindless' scrolling on Facebook


## Future Work
- allow user-definition of any time-saving websites
- make the backend ready for publication
- run very large scale study
