Zeeguu is a project that aims to support learners of foreign accelerate the acquisition of their vocabulary by a three-pronged approach:
- finding relevant articles on the net for them
- supporting their reading with translation and pronunciation support
- strengthening retention with the use of automatically and personally generated vocabulary exercises

The architecture of Zeeguu includes both a browser extension and a web application that communicate with each other.

## Papers
[**As We May Study: Towards the Web as a Personalized Language Textbook**](/docs/assets/papers/18-AsWeMayStudy.pdf)
	- in this paper we introduce the project
	- we report on a study of using it in a highschool French class in the Netherlands
	- students love and take advantage of the chance of reading on the topics that they like

[**Bootstrapping an ubiquitous monitoring ecosystem for accelerating vocabulary acquisition**](/docs/assets/papers/16-Bootstrapping.pdf) 
	- a paper that presents a generic ecosystem architecture of which Zeeguu is an instantiation 


## Future Work
- better and more meaningful progress feedback 
- more diverse exercises: e.g. reorder parts of sentence into whole with drag and drop
- add a social component: allow the learners in a class see each other's activity; allow seeing social feedback on existing articles
- create mobile applications for the various platforms; probably with a cross-platform tech, e.g. Flutter
