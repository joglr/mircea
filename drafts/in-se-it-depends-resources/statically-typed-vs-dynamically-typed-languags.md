which are better?

is this a good RQ?

why not?

too generic.

let's try to be more specific:
- which result in less bugs

is this a good question?
- well, it depends... 
	- what are the systems you are building with them
	- are you considering experienced programmers or beginners? 
	- is it for operating systems? or a web site? or a script?
	- is it a 1K LOC system or a 1M LOC system? Debian has X MLOC and many of the programs are written in C...
