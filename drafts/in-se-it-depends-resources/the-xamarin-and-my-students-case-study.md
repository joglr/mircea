my students in SE reading the documentation of Xamarin. 
then parroting it back to me.

what they did't realize.
it looked good on the paper, but as soon as they got out of the beaten track, there was no documentation. and the forums were not very active.

same story with Tizen. forums were dead and documentation was bad.

**lesson: the ecosystem matters.**
the situation with the R and the Matlab ecosystems.
- one had strict rules of code quality
- the other; just upload files on some website
