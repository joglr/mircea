Mircea Lungu is associate professor in computer science at the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk/research). Before coming to Denmark he was assistant professor at the [Faculty of Science and Engineering](http://www.rug.nl/research/fmns/?lang=en) of [University of Groningen](http://www.rug.nl/) where he was a member of the [SEARCH](http://www.cs.rug.nl/search/) research group and the [Data Science Pioneers](http://www.rug.nl/research/fmns/themes/dssc/) group. He was also part time visiting researcher in the [SWAT](https://www.cwi.nl/research-groups/software-analysis-and-transformation) group at [CWI in Amsterdam](https://www.cwi.nl/). Before that he was postdoc at the [University of Bern](http://scg.unibe.ch/) in Switzerland, and for six months, visiting researcher at [IBM TJ Watson Research Center](http://www.watson.ibm.com/index.shtml) in New York.

# Research Interests
- [Software Visualization](directions/visualization.md)
- [Empirical Studies in Software Engineering](directions/empirical-studies.md) 
- [Tools for Supporting Software Evolution](directions/tools-for-evolution)
- [Personalized Learning Environments](directions/personalized-learning-environments)

# Research Prototypes 
I always loved and I still love coding. However, nowadays I'm more of a product owner that guides and advises talented groups of students that create and evaluate innovative prototypes. Some of these projects are: 
- [Git-Truck](projects/git-truck.md) - visualizing git repositories for fun and profit
- [Flask Monitoring Dashboard](projects/flask-monitoring-dashboard.md) - a lightweight API monitor for Flask/Python systems 
- [Zeeguu](projects/zeeguu.md) - personalized adaptive reading and vocabulary practice online
- [MathsCamp](projects/maths-camp.md) - personalized maths for kids
- [Aiki](projects/aiki.md) - a browser extension that uses procrastination for good

# Student Projects
If you're interested in a student project, please look at the [list of projects available on GitHub](https://github.com/mircealungu/student-projects/). Alternatively, look at the prototypes and directions listed above. At the end of each, there are several ideas of possible future directions. Also, when contacting me for a project please **send me 1) a recent CV, 2) a transcript of your grades, and 3) a link to your GitHub repository**. This helps me understand what are your strengths and weaknesses and advise you towards more appropriate projects.
