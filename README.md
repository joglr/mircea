# Research Prototypes 
Long gone are the days when I was coding myself. (I loved those days, by the way). 
Nowadays, I'm more of a product owner that guides and advises talented groups of students that create and evaluate innovative prototypes. Some of these projects are: 
- [Git-Truck](projects/git-truck.md) - visualizing git repositories for fun and profit
- [Zeeguu](projects/zeeguu.md) - personalized  reading and vocabulary practice online
- [MathsCamp](projects/maths-camp.md) - personalized maths for kids
- [Flask Monitoring Dashboard](projects/flask-monitoring-dashboard.md) - the most lightweight API monitor for Flask systems 
- [Softwarenaut](projects/softwarenaut.md) - [discontinued] - interactive visualization of software architecture

# Student Projects
If you're interested in a student project, please look at the [list of projects available on GitHub](https://github.com/mircealungu/student-projects/). Alternatively, look at the prototypes and directions listed above. At the end of each, there are several ideas of possible future directions.
