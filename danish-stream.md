**få** - to get, to receive

present: får
present perfect: har fået

past: fik
past perfect: havde fået

future: vil få
future perfect: vil have fået



links to [verbix](https://www.verbix.com/webverbix/go.php?&D1=26&T1=f%C3%A5) in the app might be useful? 


had to correct forvejen to "i forvejen". i wonder if it will still appear in the exercises.
