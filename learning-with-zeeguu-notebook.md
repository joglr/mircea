read an [article](https://videnskab.dk/krop-sundhed/forskere-har-mistanke-om-at-autisme-og-adhd-kan-kobles-til-forstyrrelser-i-tarmbakterierne/) about a big study that seems to find a correlation between autism and ADHD. 

spent 14min in total. (zeeguu estimation: 5min)
translated quite a few words:

also, some of the triple word expressions seemed relevant. it's a pity that we don't have exercises for them at the moment? e.g. "*lidt for entusiastik*":

while practicing exercises, it is a bit funny that I have to click on the speaker icon. i'm looking at *svagheder* - why do I have to move the mouse elsewhere to pronounce it?


this one was just too hard:

after doing something like 8 or 9 exercises I got tired and abandoned the session. there was no feedback in this situation. i guess i didn't deserve it? :) or should we intercept this kind of situation maybe?
