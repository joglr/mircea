Starting with exercises today
- had one in which the context was repeated with a missing word; it was a bit easier but it felt nice

It took me three retries to get `svagheder` correctly:

was wondering: should we be more specific with the feedback? I.e., pay attention to the spelling? 

I'm thinking: would it have helped to send a reminder with the words for today via email? Such that people don't forget and too many words accumulate? Let's se that happen first :)

Started reading an [article about whether English borrowed words from Danish](https://www.zeeguu.org/read/article?id=2506904). It was quite long and I didn't finish it. 
Then did some exercises, but the words of yesterday didn't show up. There was only one word left, that I could solve because it was a triple-choice and I remembered the word I didn't get yesterday... So I solved it. 

I also had  to translate again in the text `isaer` = especially IIRC. I know I'm in the learning process with this word. 

Later I went to the exercises tab again and started getting new exercises. I guess based on today's reading. But it wasn't clear.

Read an [article](https://videnskab.dk/krop-sundhed/forskere-har-mistanke-om-at-autisme-og-adhd-kan-kobles-til-forstyrrelser-i-tarmbakterierne/) about a big study that seems to find a correlation between autism and ADHD. 

spent 14min in total. (zeeguu estimation: 5min)
translated quite a few words:

also, some of the triple word expressions seemed relevant. it's a pity that we don't have exercises for them at the moment? e.g. "*lidt for entusiastik*":

while practicing exercises, it is a bit funny that I have to click on the speaker icon. i'm looking at *svagheder* - why do I have to move the mouse elsewhere to pronounce it?


this one was just too hard:

after doing something like 8 or 9 exercises I got tired and abandoned the session. there was no feedback in this situation. i guess i didn't deserve it? :) or should we intercept this kind of situation maybe?
