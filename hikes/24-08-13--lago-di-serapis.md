Super busy

1300 - Chains are needed for the ones who don't like heights; the fall to the left is super abrupt

It's so busy and so many people that are not used with the mountain that when you stop to give priority to the ones going up, people are really surprised. At some point I got twenty *grazie* in a row I think. That's quite a surge is serotonin I think. 

  

(Musing: Every time I think zeeguu is a bad name i remember hoka and airtox...)

  

13.40 - finally at the lake. Beautiful glacial colors. And many people to enjoy it. The photo does not do justice to the number of tourists. And so many French today!
