# Mini-Incursion Into the Grand Canyon

October 8, 2024


The day off, between VISSOFT and ICSME we took a trip down to the Grand Canyon. 

We were based in Flagstaff, so went to the South Rim. 

Because of car rental issues, we left Flagstaff around 9.30 and arrived at the entrance of the park around 11. Although it was a Tuesday we found at huge traffic jam before the entrance. Spent more than one hour in the queue. 

Once past the entrance, very quickly the road opens onto the canyon. We saw it, we stopped and jumped off to admire and take photos. 

The view from the South Rim is indeed spectacular, and photos can not really do it justice.
