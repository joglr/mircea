# Mini-Hike Down the Grand Canyon

October 8, 2024


The day off between VISSOFT and ICSME we took a trip to the Grand Canyon with a bunch of VISSOFTers. Since we were based in Flagstaff we went to the South Rim. 

Because of car rental issues, we left Flagstaff around 9.30 and arrived at the entrance of the park around 11. Although it was a Tuesday, we found at huge traffic jam before the entrance, and spent more than one hour in the queue. We had read online that if you have an access ticket you can take the left lane and be faster. We stopped thus in a city before the entrance to buy tickets. It did not help. Nobody respects enforces the rule about the left lane as of 2024. 

Once past the entrance, very quickly the road opens onto the canyon. We saw it, and we just had to stop. Parked in the first available space we found and got off to admire and take photos.

The view from the South Rim is indeed spectacular, and photos can not really do it justice.

We realized that the trail we were planning to take was only 15min of walking away, so we continued on foot. 

Soon we were at the South Kaybab Trail and we start down. The trail starts abruptly and soon one starts to feel inside of the canyon.

Gregorio, Leonel, and David, my VISSOFT co-organizers are leading the pack. Only Jesus is missing!

We quickly arrive to the first named point on the trail is the famous Ooh-Aah point where Valentin looks happy.

The red-dust trail continues spectacularly.

About one hour and a quarter after starting down we arrive at Cedar Ridge. We take a group photo with the brave and then we go back up because we have budgeted for going up twice as much as going down, and we did start quite late... 


The only slight disappointment is that, as we talk to two other hikers, we learn that if we continued to Skeleton Point (probably 45min more), we could have seen the Colorado River. Next disappointment for me is the next day when at ICSME I met one of the students of Andrea Capiluppi who went all the way down a day before. That must be really amazing. I wish I did that. Maybe another time.
