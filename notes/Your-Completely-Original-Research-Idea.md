If your research idea is so original, that nobody did anything similar before, then there is a good chance that you're wrong.

I mean, think about how many stupid ideas you’ve seen already. It does not matter how stupid they are, somebody has already thought about them. If it’s hard to come up with an original stupid idea, how about something that’s really brilliant?

Modern art is, it seems to me, a domain where originality is an ideal to which people aspire. The other day I saw that a Dutch artist [turned a Dead Ostrich into a Quadcopter](https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS-4s0ilxhs). I guess this is quite original. (Surely, if you don’t consider that he has done the same thing with his cat before.) And incredibly dumb. And already taken. 

At the beginning of my PhD, I remember talking to a professor that I respected a lot who was a pioneer in the domain in which I was trying to contribute to. And she told me, not to worry if what I did was not original at the moment. If I did it on my own, and if I kept going I was going to bring a new perspective to the field since it would be impossible that I did things exactly like everybody else. And she was right.

If other people have similar ideas to yours, that’s good. In economics they call it that there is a market for your product. It means there is potential in there. So keep going!

Also, if your research idea is so original, that nobody did anything similar before,  … then look again at the related work.

You would be amazed by how often when you do a comprehensive search of the related work you discover that another scientist stole your idea, traveled with it back in time, and published it in a prestigious conference before you…

This is why doing a literature survey at the beginning of the PhD is better than at the end when you are writing the thesis. On the other hand, if after doing survey the idea starts to look less original than at the beginning … read the previous post to realize that this is good news
