Today I helped teach kids programming, planned two theses with bachelor students, worked on a stubborn research problem with a PhD student, fixed some culinary details for an event with our secretary, bid on reviewing some of the latest papers published in software engineering, and pair programmed with a computer science professor.Â 

Beat that, the most interesting man in the world!
