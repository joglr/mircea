#### Maybe we should throw our phones into a lake of fire
Our relationship with the phones in our pocket is so similar to the one of Frodo and the ring - it would always call for him, and he would always feel the compulsion to take it out and put it on. Our relationship with the social media is the same thing and I think it's a different thing. And the combination of having in your pocket both at the same time makes it just much more attractive / addictive. Frodo was right to destroy the damn thing with fire. Us OTOH...



#### Why a personal God? 
Why do religions imagine gods as persons? Because we're a social species and thinking in terms of other persons comes naturally to us. Also, because this enables us to have a object for our feelings of "thankfulness" and "anger". It would be meaningless to be thankful to the universe. Or the multiverse. And one can not be angry with the universe when, say, their child dies (see Decalog Ep.1). In a sense, believing in a personal God allows one to be more expressive with their feelings than than otherwise. 

#### Does mostly empty space have free will? 
We have no free will. It's the same as saying: humans are mostly made out of empty space. Indeed, both might be true at the microscopic level. Indeed, every atom is mostly empty, because the electrons and the neutrons are so small, that most of the space in them is actually empty space. But at the societal level, that level of granularity is meaningless. At the societal level when individual punches another in the nose, we don't go saying: it does not matter, it's mostly empty space pushing on other mostly empty space. The same about free will. Even if the universe were deterministic (and this is opposed by our understanding of quantum physics), but even if it were all pure mechanics, talking about atoms at the level of the individual in society, is meaningless. So yes, humans have free will, atoms don't.
