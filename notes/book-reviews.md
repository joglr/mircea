## 2023

### January

**The Dark Forest** (Audio) 
- the book is in a sense better than the previous one; galaxy-scale and centuries-scale science fiction, that still succeeds in following a "reluctant" protagonist (Luo Ji)
- the book has a huge suspense arc if one knows the dark forest theory.  indeed, the solution of Luo Ji is in some sense quite obvious, and once it is set in motion, one can only be eager to see whether it works. (although now I start to wonder whether in a dark forrest, one ever starts an expedition like the one of the trisolarians...)
- the alien attack is awe-inspiring - one of the most memorable descriptions of a first encounter with a superior technology that I remember reading
- towards the end there was a certain feeling of deus-ex-machina


## 2022 

**The Three Body Problem** (October, audio)
- Learning about the "struggle sessions" during the Chinese cultural revolution; scary how much harm and misery can be brought about by people with good intentions; impressive to see the madness of the crowds; interesting to see glimpses of that on social media; social media really is the 'wild west'
- In parts the book seems too longwinded; some of the motivations of the characters are not convincing; some of the plot feels a bit cartoonish rather than science-fiction
- Didn't make me want to read the second part



**The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure** (September, audio)
- J. Haidt G. Lukianoff
- Very well written 
- I liked the fact that they start with the goal of understanding the new generation rather than from the premise of judging 
- The initial parable of the wise man in a cave in Greece is memorable
