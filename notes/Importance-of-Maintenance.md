We're spending too much time chasing the flashy new thing: quantum computing, deep learning, artificial (general!) intelligence, etc. 

And while at it, we forget one important thing: software maintenance and evolution. 

Software maintenance is like plumbing. If it does not work, then none of the things built o top of it will not work either. 

We need more research in software maintenance, or software evolution as it is called nowadays.
