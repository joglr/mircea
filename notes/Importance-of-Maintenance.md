We're spending too much time chasing the flashy new thing: quantum computing, blockchains, artificial (general!) intelligence, etc. 

And while at it, we forget one important thing: the huge societal benefits that we get from software come from the "good old" programming. The traditional specifying with ultimate precision what you want your systems to do. This ensures that your salary is computed correctly, that your car locking system function safely, that your bank transfers are done securely, and that your flight booking is communicated to the airport automated doors. 

This kind of "good old" programming makes up probably more than 99% of all the source code out there.

Moreover, even the systems that include AI and blockchains (and quantym algorithms wherever they might come) are mostly made up of the good old programming. The whole AI part can be easily hidden behind one "function" in the system. A function that we don't always understand how it works, but a function still. It sometimes returns a boolean and sometimes even a floating point number. But a function still. The craddle of all these promising new technologies is still the traditional software written by software engineers. 

And this traditional software is more and more complex, and requires more and more maintenance. Unfortunately, everybody forgets about it. And although software maintenance and evolution research is not "cool", it's essential. Software maintenance and evolution is like plumbing: you only realize how important it is when it breaks

We need more research in software plumbing.
