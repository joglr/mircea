[oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- Cool plugins and themes for the .zsh when used from Terminal in OS X
- The z plugin for command line autocomplete
- supports themes, installed in $ZSH/custom
	- one nice theme is [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)

[direnv](https://direnv.net/)
- automatically load envvars when one `cd`'s to a given folder
- super useful to automatically load python environments when one switches to a project folder

[command line fuzzy finder](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- I use it mostly to intercept `Ctrl+R` and have a powerful way of searching the command history





# Browser Enhancements

[Custom New Tab URL](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/custom-new-tab-url/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia)
- So you can set a new tab in Chrome to open with something that you care about; in my case it's my most frequently used shortcuts
- Chrome only has the concept of a Home address in the configuration, but that's not open by default; still useful as a backup because you can use a shortcut to open it


# OS Improvements
[BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/)

- i like to map `Command+{j,k,l,h}` onto arrows, so i can navigate w/o the need to find the arrows

`pmset` - [schedule wake up times for machine](https://www.howtoisolve.com/how-to-schedule-mac-turn-on-off-and-sleep-wake/#Schedule-Wake-Timel)- useful for running cron jobs, e.g.
