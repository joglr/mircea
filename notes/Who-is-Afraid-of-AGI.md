AGI stands for Artificial General Intelligence. 
It is theoretized to be the level of AI at which an "algorithm" is as intelligent as a human. It is the "phylosopher's stone" of the modern techno-alchemist.

The Sillycon Valley hackers are afraid (Elon Musk reportedly can't sleep at night because of worries) that once we invent AGI there is only one small step to inventing something that is "even more intelligent than humans". At that point, that more-intelligent-than-humans-algorith will start improving itself. And soon after that, the techno-apocalypse comes because the super-AGI is now so much more intelligent than humans and it might just as well decide to dispose with our species. 

In this essay I will try to explain why those who are afraid of AGI are literally afraid of mathematics. And you're usually not very smart when you're afraid of mathematics.
