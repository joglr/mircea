#### Maybe we should throw our phones into a lake of fire

Our relationship with our phones is very similar to the one of Frodo and the ring. The ring in his pocket would always call for him, and he would always feel the compulsion to take it out and try it on. Also, when he would put it on, he would see crazy stuff (if I remember correctly scenes from the movie... I also read the book, but I don't remember that part from reading. Would the fact that you remember different thingsbe an argument for both reading and watching the same novel?)

Our relationship with the social media is of a very similar nature. It also calls to us from our pocket, and we also see crazy stuff when we connect to it. 

The combination of having in our pocket both the phone and social media on it, makes the combo twice more addictive. 

Frodo was right to destroy the ring by throwing it in the fire. The ring in our pocket OTOH, our precious, seems to be here to stay. 

Ah, and too much exposure to the ring made a monster out of Gollum.



#### Why a personal God? 

Why do religions imagine gods as persons? 

Because we're a social species and thinking in terms of other persons comes naturally to us. And things, but I guess things are out of the question for this one. 

Thinking about God as a person enables us to have a object for our feelings of "thankfulness" and "anger". It would be meaningless to be thankful to the universe. Or the multiverse. Also, one can not be angry with the universe when, say, their child dies (see Decalog by Kieslovski, Ep.1). In a sense, believing in a personal God allows one to be more expressive with their feelings than otherwise. 

#### Does *mostly* empty space have free will? 

We have no free will is the same as saying: humans are mostly made out of empty space. Indeed, both might be true at the microscopic level, but it's the wrong abstraction level when you talk about humans. 

Indeed, because the electrons and the nucleus are so smal and the forces between them fo strong, most of the space in the atom is actually empty. And thus, every human is mostly empty because they are made out of atoms. But at the societal level, that level of granularity is meaningless. 

The same about free will. Even if the universe were deterministic (and this is opposed by our understanding of quantum physics), but even if it were all pure mechanics, talking about atoms at the level of the individual in society, is meaningless. It would be like when an individual punches another in the nose, we would say: it does not matter, it's mostly empty space pushing on other mostly empty space. No, it's not empty space hitting empty space. It's a person, who *decided* to punch the other one. And at the level of society, we judge that act as it were the will of the puncher. Not the turning of some atomic gears. 

Also, there's quantum uncertainty at the atomic level, so it's very unlikely that the universe is deterministic anyway. 


#### Artificial Wisdom
I recently developed a love for volleyball and I play in the lowest men's danish league. My role in the team, middle blocker, requires a lot of jumping, and my knee is starting to hurt a bit sometimes after a long match. I really wish that as a society we would prioritize much more working on artificial knees than artificial intelligence. But there’s not enough wisdom in Sillicon valley to realize that. 

And unfortunately nobody is working on artificial wisdom either. 


#### My own short text and idea timeline

Why not maintain my own timeline of silly little thoughts. I used to try to contribute my thoughts to Twitter. But that's a cacophony of everybody's thoughts. And Elon holds the button that turns craziness up and down. If somebody (why would they?) would want to read my thoughts, why should they go to Twitter, to see them interleaved with Bitcoin advertising and dancing cats? I'm too proud for that. My ideas deserve to stand apart from the twitter madness.
