#### The *"In Software It Depends"* Course

I'd love to have a software engineering master's course where we look at modern technologies, especially the *hype-du-jour*, and discuss when do they make sense and when do they do not. And teach the students to disentangle the exaggeration from the actually useful. 

Intro lecture
- historical technologies that everybody believed in that later turned out that were not as useful as hoped (formal verification, scrum, object-orientation, supercomputers, Map-Reduce, ORM, MongoDB, the Blockchain, etc.)

Project
- choose one of the technologies du jour, explain it, show where it works well, and write a critique, with counter-examples; e.g., going to the cloud <- coming from the cloud, lambda functions, etc.
- possible topics at the moment, e.g.: generative AI, lambda functions, Elixir, statically typed Javascript (e.g. Typescript)
- for the projects where there's a product that hypes it (e.g. Xamarin) - take the website, and be able to criticize it
- optional: prototype / find realistic case study


P.S. A special module of that course would be the "It is not new, anyway" module, in which we take the modern techniques and see that there was (almost always) a predecessor that everybody forgot about it (e.g. deep learning, server side rendering, etc.).

#### Software engineering: forever reinventing of the wheel or an eternal ascending spiral? 

I always thought that I should write a book about "the eternal return of computer science" in which I talk about how there's this eternal "reinvention of the wheel". Fat client - thin client - fat client - ... No types - strong types - no types - strong types... etc. 

However, I wonder if it would be more polite and more optimistic to phrase it as the *eternal spiral*. The benefit of the spiral metaphor is that it allows for learning, it allows for a progression. It's also more humble and less judgemental and less fatalistic: computer science progress is not an eternal groundhog day. It's more like the solar system where the planets rotate around the sun and together with the sun they travel around the universe :)


#### Day #1 of No Sugar Fasting

Re-starting my no-artificial sugar challenge today. After having a cookie with my father this morning for coffee, I will try to not have any stuff that contains sugars or sweeteners for the next 40 days. 
I've failed to keep the fastelavn with the danes. Maybe I'll be able to (mostly) align myself with the orthodox now, who already started and will fast for the next month.
Rules of the engagement: no artificial sugars in food or drinks. Including no exaggeratedly sweetened home-made smoothies, e.g. two bananas in a smoothie is too much. In general, it's the sugar taste that I feel cravings for and I must learn to let go of. Thus, even if it's made of fruits, if it's too sweet (e.g., fresh pressed fruit juice) it's still a no go. That would be cheating. So that's excluded too. Sweeteners are also off the table. 

In case I fail, I restart counting. 

P.S. Also, will try also no gluten to the best of my ability: there's the story with Djokovic improving his athletic performance when doing that. I would like to improve mine too. I guess this is a test of how much I want that improvement. 


#### Equity = The Opposite of Equality of Outcomes 

I don't understand the culture wars. 

Equity, cf to the dictionary on my machine, is *the quality of being fair and impartial*. Now, given that we know that each human has their preferences and capabilities, will inevitably lead to different outcomes. However, as far as I can tell, people who claim they want equity,  refer to equality of outcomes. I guess it's a technique taken from advertising: claim that you deliver something that you absolutely do not do (e.g. airlines - comfort, detergents - family happiness, etc.)

Turns out that I agree with Solzhenitsyn on this one: "Human beings are born with different capacities. If they are free, they are not equal. And if they are equal, they are not free". 

But I guess what people want is fairness, and given that everybody starts from

#### Maybe we should throw our phones into a lake of fire

Our relationship with our phones is very similar to the one of Frodo and the ring. The ring in his pocket would always call for him, and he would always feel the compulsion to take it out and try it on. Also, when he would put it on, he would see crazy stuff (if I remember correctly scenes from the movie... I also read the book, but I don't remember that part from reading. Would the fact that you remember different things be an argument for both reading and watching the same novel?)

Our relationship with the social media is of a very similar nature. It also calls to us from our pocket, and we also see crazy stuff when we connect to it. The combination of having in our pocket both the phone and social media on it, makes the combo twice more addictive. Frodo was right to destroy the ring by throwing it in the fire. The device in our pockets, on the other hand, seems to be there to stay. 

Ah, and too much exposure to the ring made a monster out of Gollum!



#### Why a personal God? 

Why do religions imagine gods as persons? 

Because we're a social species and thinking in terms of other persons comes naturally to us. And things, but I guess things are out of the question for this one. 

Thinking about God as a person enables us to have a object for our feelings of "thankfulness" and "anger". It would be meaningless to be thankful to the universe. Or the multiverse. Also, one can not be angry with the universe when, say, their child dies (see Decalog by Kieslovski, Ep.1). In a sense, believing in a personal God allows one to be more expressive with their feelings than otherwise. 



#### Does *mostly* empty space have free will? 

We have no free will is the same as saying: humans are mostly made out of empty space. Indeed, both might be true at the microscopic level, but it's the wrong abstraction level when you talk about humans. 

Indeed, because the electrons and the nucleus are so smal and the forces between them so strong, most of the space in the atom is actually empty. And thus, every human is *mostly empty space*. But at the societal level, that level of analysis is meaningless. 

The same with free will. Even if the universe were deterministic at the atomic level, talking about how humans are made of atoms when discussing ethics and society is meaningless. It would be like when an individual punches another in the nose, we would say: it does not matter, it's mostly empty space pushing on other mostly empty space. No, it's not empty space hitting empty space. It's a person, who *decided* to punch the other one. And at the level of ethics, we judge that act as it were the will of the puncher. Not the turning of some atomic clockwork. 

Also, there's quantum uncertainty at the atomic level. 

P.S. (Apr 2) Or could I accept that both facts are true? The wisdom of the Rabbi who told everybody that they were right? 


#### Artificial Wisdom
I recently developed a love for volleyball and I play in the lowest men's danish league. My role in the team, middle blocker, requires a lot of jumping, and my knee is starting to hurt a bit sometimes after a long match. I really wish that as a society we would prioritize much more working on artificial knees than artificial intelligence. But there’s not enough wisdom in Sillicon Valley to realize that. And unfortunately nobody is working on artificial wisdom either. 


#### My own short text and idea timeline

Why not maintain my own timeline of silly little thoughts? I used to try to contribute my thoughts to Twitter. But that's a cacophony of everything, thoughts, the most outrageous recent things, advertising in your face, and covert. And Elon holds the button that turns craziness up and down there too.
