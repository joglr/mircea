## The Maintainability Challenge - Exemplified

- Asking ChatGPT how to [detect if a web page runs on mobile](https://chat.openai.com/c/7305bbcc-a0a6-4c64-b263-e6133c69c5d0) will result in a solution that one can copy-paste
- Asking Copilot to write it ... - it generates code - whether it works, or why does it work... how is one to know? 
- Finding an [answer on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11381673/detecting-a-mobile-browser) with the help of Google Search
- Finding a library to do this on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ismobilejs) - 260K downloads / week
- Searching on SO itself is [horrible](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=javascript+function+to+detect+if+code+runs+on+mobile%3F&s=2b6050df-922e-4754-a94c-aaca6d996c51) 

Which of these is more ... ?
- maintainable and more future proof
- easier in the moment
- more trustworthy

You can ask ChatGPT to explain but... can you trust it? What if the explanation is a hallucination? Same with Copilot. The only way you can trust it is if you already know the answer, and it functions as a reminder. Or if the answer is at the periphery of your knowledge (e.g. function currying, PBI in scrum). 

StackOverflow has a reputation system. This is invaluable. You know that the answer of Jon Skeet is more trustworthy. And an ever-continuing conversation. And you see how it has arrived to that solution. Also, you can easily fix the traceability of the code by adding a url to the solution in the code. In theory, one could create some semblance of usability with code annotations that would also track the code that was generated together with the context. 

npm = an ecosystem perspective.
