**The Three Body Problem** (October)
- Learning about the "struggle sessions" during the Chinese cultural revolution; scary how much harm and misery can be brought about by people with good intentions; scary to see the mob madness
- In parts the book seems too longwinded; some of the motivations of the characters are not convincing



**# The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure** 
- J. Haidt G. Lukianoff
- Very well written 
- I liked the fact that they start with the goal of understanding the new generation rather than from the premise of judging
