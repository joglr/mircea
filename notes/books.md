## 2022 

**The Three Body Problem** (October, audio)
- Learning about the "struggle sessions" during the Chinese cultural revolution; scary how much harm and misery can be brought about by people with good intentions; impressive to see the madness of the crowds; interesting to see glimpses of that on social media; social media really is the 'wild west'
- In parts the book seems too longwinded; some of the motivations of the characters are not convincing; some of the plot feels a bit cartoonish rather than science-fiction
- Didn't make me want to read the second part



**The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure** (September, audio)
- J. Haidt G. Lukianoff
- Very well written 
- I liked the fact that they start with the goal of understanding the new generation rather than from the premise of judging
