[effect of liquid carbodopa-levodopa](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375958446_The_effect_of_liquid_gold_levodopa-carbidopa_ascorbic_acid_solution_in_patients_with_Parkinson's_disease) - seems to be absorbed faster
- LCAS = levo...-carbi..-ascorbic acid solution
- study of 20 patients with severe sympthoms
	- - strong effects for the first month then plateau
	- hypothesis: downregulation of dopamine D2 receptors due to exposure to high dopamine levels
- 2017 - yang et al. - out of 38 patients, 1/3 only continued after 12 months; reasons: diskynsia; younger age and severe mood-cognitive disorders strongly associated

[dissolving levodopa in vitamin c solution might improve absorption](dissolving the levodopa in a vitamin C solution and sipping it may also improve absorption (orange juice is commonly used). You may consider these options and also consider long term a gastroenterology consultation.)

[long term impact](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8189983/) of LC-intestnial gel 
- literature review
- off time reduced with 40% - 84%
- meaningful improvement in quality of life
- 83% reduction at 3-5 years
> The studies reviewed here show that after 1 year or more, the reductions of ‘off’-time that occur after starting LCIG therapy remain, i.e., the proportion of the waking day spent in ‘off’ is reduced compared with baseline by > 2 h, and in many cases > 4 h. These improvements were accompanied by more time spent in the ‘on’ state, and in most studies there was also a reduction in the duration of dyskinesia. Such changes in ‘on/off’-time are likely to have an impact on the patients’ ADL and QoL


[testimonial](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information-and-support/your-magazine/stories/duodopa-pump-changed-my-life) of somebody with a duodopa pump
- When levodopa was wearing off, I was freezing and had a real sense of ‘shutting down’. At the other extreme, I experienced such severe dyskinesia (involuntary movements) that I was walking into walls. It was embarrassing to those I was with and attracted stares from strangers. 
- Sometimes, the violence of the rolling movement would make me vomit. Experiences such as being unable to leave a cinema at the end of a movie, get up after a meal or get through a railway ticket barrier were becoming common and stressful. I no longer had the confidence to go out. Getting to the loo became a serious issue, even at home. My driving licence had also been revoked.
- I now go out to meet friends, I have been to the theatre. I have travelled long distances as a passenger by car and train without fear of freezing or getting stuck.
- I do still get dyskinesia, in spite of the wonderful nurses’ best attempts to adjust the dose – although so far it has not caused vomiting. The stoma site, where the tube goes in above my belly button, is sometimes often uncomfortable. Fatigue and lack of stamina are still a problem, along with some other non-motor issues.
- If you're considering this treatment, you will need to balance the pros and cons. On the one hand, there is having surgery, having to flush out tubes and keep the stoma clean, travelling with the gel cassettes in a cool boxes, the wardrobe of clothes that can no longer be worn and perhaps body image issues. On the other hand, there is the life-enhancing effect of being able to get out and about.
- For me, the decision to proceed down the Duodopa pump path was absolutely the right one. I’ll always be grateful to my medical team and fellow patient for their time and advice in helping me make it.
