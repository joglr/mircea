Generative ML are all the hype at the moment. Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot that integrate large language models (LLM)  get a lot of positive attention. Facebook/Meta have published and then retracted a similar experiment dubbed Galactica, which raised outrage. Blinded by the success of the ChatGPT we forgot about the limitations of these tools. Some of the most intelligent people I know are wondering whether this will change education. I am more moderate in my expectations.

## Generative ML Models vs. Electronic Calculators
(Jan 18, '23)

I head people compare ChatGPT with electronic calculators. They observe that once electronic calculators  were here, we stopped needing to teach and evaluate students capacity to do arithmetic computations. Maths educators started teaching other high-level skills. They wonder whether it's going to be the same with ChatGPT and Co-Pilot. 


### Code Generators
With respect to code, we're clearly not in the same predicament. These tools can only be a parasite, or to put it nicer, a "sidecar" in the presence of the main "engine": large amounts of code written by real developers that these tools are trained on. If developers stop writing new code, these tools don't have what to interpolate. So the skill of writing code will never go away. 

What might end up happening is that for every new technology, and every new language, a cohort of pioneers will go in and carve the path. After they have written sufficiently many programs that use that new language or API the large language model will start providing decent recommendations for "the masses". 

In any case, because of the need for a large number of examples that these systems need before they can become useful, the generative ML models will never do to programing what calculators did to arithmetic. 


### Text Generators
The need to be able to write will also not go away anytime soon. Not before the need to think will do. This because writing and thinking are tightly integrated. You can't have one without the other. (Ok, you can have writing w/o thinking with the help of LLM)

Thus, yes, the general essay about "life in a village in the southern france" can be automatically be generated. It can even be generated in the form of a sonnet. Or a hip-hop song in the style of Snoop dogg. But a thesis on "a tool that intercepts procrastination in order to induce more useful habits" will not be "generated" anytime soon. 

To think about
- Will this result in an even more frantic pace of innovation and adoption of new libraries? As soon as sufficient examples are available, everybody can quickly start porting their systems to the library *du jour*... 


## Will ChatGPT render knowing how to write irellevant?

Will it render knowing how to think irellevant?


## A Valid Use Case: The Ultimate Auto-Correct

Given that these systems are good at predicting text, and most(?) of the writers of texts and reports at the moment are non-native speakers, I expect that one of the most wonderful usages will be correcting prose to make it more readable and understandable. Oh, how happy will I be if my students started using ChatGPT and they sent in more readable reports!  

A workflow that I imagine is writing a paragraph, and then submitting it to ChatGPT asking it to rephrase for clarity. 

However, a serious responsibility of the writer using the workflow above is making sure that the "corrected" text still expresses the original idea. Indeed, while the past spell checkers didn't change the meaning of the text, the new generation will rephrase boldly, and at times will change the meaning. Thus, the writer has to attentively scrutinize the work of their co-author and ensure that it still expresses the original idea.
