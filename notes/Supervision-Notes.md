A few notes on how to make the most of student projects.

## Emails the Day Before the Weekly Meeting

The working day before our meeting I would kindly ask you to send (to the supervisors) an email in which you answer the following concisely: 
1. **Progress**: what progress did you make in the last week?
2. **Blockers**: are there any issues that are blocking you?
3. **Next**: what is the plan for the next week?
4. **Asks of supervisors**: Do you need help with anything from the supervisors? 

Also, if you do not actually need a sync meeting, that is perfectly cool for me. Async might be even a more efficient use of time sometimes; so let us use the time wisely.
