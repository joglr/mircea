A few notes on how to make the most of student projects.

## Emails the Day Before the Weekly Meeting

The working day before our meeting I would kindly ask you to send an email with the following: 
1. **Progress**. What progress did you make in the last week?
2. **Blockers**. Are there any issues that are blocking you?
3. **Next**. What is the plan for the next week?
4. **Help**. Do you need any help from the supervisor(s)? 

Also, if it's the case, mention that you need
- **no meeting at all** because there was no progress or because you still have work to do: that is perfectly cool for me
- an **online meeting** - they normally equally fine as the in-person ones for me.
