A few notes on how to make the most of student projects.

## Emails the Day Before the Weekly Meeting

The working day before our meeting I would kindly ask you to send (to the supervisors) an email in which you answer the following questions concisely: 
1. What progress did you make in the last week?
2. Are there any issues that are blocking you?
3. What is the plan for the next week?
4. Do you need help with anything? 

Also, if you do not actually need a sync meeting, then you can always choose to do a async (written) update via email. Let us use the time wisely.
