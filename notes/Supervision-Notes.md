# Supervision Notes

A few notes on how to make the most of student projects.

## Emails the Day Before the Weekly Meeting

The working day before our meeting I would kindly ask you to send an email with the following structure: 
1. **Progress**. What progress did you make in the last week?
2. **Blockers**. Are there any issues that are blocking you?
3. **Next**. What is the plan for the next week?
4. **Help**. Do you need any help from the supervisor(s)? 

Also, mention if you need
- **an online meeting** - they are usually just as effective as the in-person ones
- **no meeting at all** - usually when there was no progress, or because you know what to do and just need more time
