## Emails the Day Before

The working day before our meeting I would kindly ask you to send (to the supervisors) an email in which you answer the following questions concisely: 
- what progress did you make in the last week?
- are there any issues that are blocking you?
- what is the plan for the next week?
- do you need help with anything? 
- do you actually need a meeting?
