A few notes on how to make the most of student projects.

## Emails the Day Before the Weekly Meeting

The working day before our meeting I would kindly ask you to send (to the supervisors) an email in which you answer the following concisely: 
1. **Progress**. What progress did you make in the last week?
2. **Blockers**. Are there any issues that are blocking you?
3. **Next**. What is the plan for the next week?
4. **Help**. Do you need any help from me (or the other supervisors when this is the case)? 

Also, if you do not actually need a sync meeting, that is perfectly cool for me. Async might be even a more efficient use of time sometimes; so let us use the time wisely.
