Researchers might have the desire to maintain a software prototype for the longer term. Some of the most impactful research has been done with tools that were long lived. 

However, maintaining tools is expensive in academia. It would be important for the researchers to gain knowledge about how their tool is being used, and if it is being used. This would sever both for motivation, but also to realize whether some parts of the tool are not too used, so they might be removed. 

There is another pattern: web applications that are running locally. Indeed, node has enabled this pattern. And it is important for researchers, again, because this architecture does not require them to maintain a service with all the costs attached. 

However, how are they to know how their tool is being used if it's not a web application. Telemetry is the answer. But given that they do research, would it not make sense for the telemetry data to be also open. Open source, open telemetry. It ryhmes. But does it work? And which are the challenges? And how to do it in a sustainable manner?
