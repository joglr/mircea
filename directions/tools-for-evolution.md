# Software Evolution

> A software system either evolves or becomes progressively irellevant (M. Lehman)

> The best way to predict the future is to invent it. (Peter Drucker)

In order to predict the future of software evolution tools we aim to invent and evaluate new tool prototypes that improve developer work. Some of the software evolution research prototypes that I have built or supervised or collaborated to over the years are: 

- [Softwarenaut](/projects/softwarenaut) - visualizing high-level dependencies between modules of  a system 
- [Git-Truck](/projects/git-truck) - language independnet repository evolution visualization
- Replay - [paper 1] [paper 2]  [paper 3]  an idea that was ahead of its time that I still expect that we will see again - a tool that records development interactions with the IDE and allows future developers to replay them with the goal of understanding them
