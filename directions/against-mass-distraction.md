# Tools for Fighting Against Mass Distraction

Somebody called the social media apps: the weapons of mass **distraction**. 

## Papers
- [Aiki: Turning Procrastination into Microlearning](https://scholar.google.nl/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=15348622816588107352) 
	- A study with Nanna Inie 
	- Show that people who want to learn Danish can use redirection from time-wasting-websites as a strategy and cue to remember that they should learn
	- Our participants learned quite a bit of Danish and some of them actually found the learning a better use of their time than the 'mindless' scrolling on Facebook

## Project Ideas
- Generalizing Aiki so it allows redirection to any activity not only Danish learning; studying whether the choice of activity results in participants being more engaged
