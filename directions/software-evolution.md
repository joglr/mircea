# Software Evolution

A software system either evolves or becomes progressively irellevant (M. Lehman)

In order to invent the future of tools and techniques that will help support software evolution I am interested in two directions:
- empirically studying existing developer practices
- inventing and trying out new tool prototypes that would improve developer practices
