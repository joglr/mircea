The Danes tell about themselves that they do not have natural resources, but they have trust. And that they consider this an important resource. 

# Bitcoin - a Reminder of the Importance of Trust

Bitcoin and the blockchain-based algorithm that it is built on is a fascinatingly smart consensus algorithm. A beautiful piece of engineering. But it is also a fantastic reminder of the importance of trust. 

Let me explain.

Because we wanted to have the possibility of transfering money without trusting any individual or institution we invented the protocol, which in order to ensure 5 transactions per second wastes more than the energy of Ireland. This would not be sufficient for the peak hour on market day in my grandma's village. Let alone as a global payment system. But it's not the lack of scalability that matters for my current argument, but rather the very large amount of energy that it requires. 

The alternative would have been to trust an individual, or an organization and then, they could ensure with the help of a Raspbery Pi hundreds of times more transactions per second. 

Isn't it beautiful? Bitcoin is an extremely expensive way of showing how valuable trust is. 

In fact, now that I live in Denmark, I remember a conversation I had once with somebody on a plane who was arguing that "the danes know that their country does not have natural resources, but what they consider that it's the most imporatnt resource they have is: trust".
