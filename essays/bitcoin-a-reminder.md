# Bitcoin - a Reminder of the Importance of Trust

And it is also a fascinatingly smart consensus algorithm. But is also a fantastic reminder of the importance of trust. 

Let me explain.

Because we wanted to have the possibility of transfering money without trusting any individual or institution we invented the protocol, which in order to ensure 5 transactions per second wastes more than the energy of Ireland. 

The alternative would have been to trust an individual, or an organization and then, they could ensure with the help of a Raspbery Pi hundreds of times more transactions per second. 

Isn't it beautiful? Bitcoin is an extremely expensive way of showing how important trust is. 

In fact, now that I live in Denmark, I remember a conversation I had once with somebody on a plane who was arguing that "the danes know that their country does not have natural resources, but what they consider that it's the most imporatnt resource they have is: trust".
